#### **Main Authors** of this repository: Dr Kate Meeson and Dr Joanne Watson
#### **Corresponding Author:** Kate Meeson: kate.meeson@manchester.ac.uk
### **Aim of project:** To explore the metabolism of CHO cells and optimise their IgG production
### **Flux analysis method:** Flux sampling workflow using the Coordinate hit-and-run with rounding algorithm (PMID: 28158334; Haraldsd√≥ttir et al, 2017)
### **Statistical approach:** This flux sampling workflow uses Mann-Whitney U test to identify the reactions significantly associated with the 95th percentile of high IgG-producing sampling solutions
### **GEM, integration algorithm and collaboration:** This flux sampling algorithm has been applied to an adapted version of the iCHO2441 Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) genome-scale model (PMID: 36866411; Strain et al, 2023), which has been constrained using transcriptomics data generated by the Edinburgh Genomics department, as part of a Prosperity Partnership Project, funded by EPSRC and BBSRC, in collaboration with FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies, Billingham, UK. The algorithm used to constrain this model was developed by Timouma et al, 2024 (PMID: 38819150; Timouma et al, 2024)
